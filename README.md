# James-Webb-Data

About:
The objective of this tutorial is to promote James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) data and facilitate its use. 
Our goal is to  provide the user with a simple yet effective method to opening and extracting JWST data and 
to present an example of what canbe done with this data.


Run the script:
pip install -r requirements.txt


 
 Expected Behavior: 

JWST_Jupyter_Tutorial.ipynb will guide the user on the steps to downloading and extracting the JWST data.
Next, the tutorial will demonstrate how to open the data and save it as an image for further uses.
The last step involves creating a filter that looks at all the brightspots in the image. 
This experimental filter can be adjusted by the user to change the brightness threshold along with the number of nearby pixels required. 
Any pixels that do not meet the filter criteria will be turned to black.
The remaining will be documented and circled, presenting the user with an estimate of the number of galaxies in the image.
